# Research Assistant Agent 🕵️‍♀️
This talk already I deliver at some event at Build with AI 2025 in Indonesia. I deliver this example as an talk session and workshop.
This project is a **Research Assistant Agent** built using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. It's designed to help you with your research tasks by automating the process of gathering and summarizing information from paper that obtained that relates to the keyword given.

## What it does 🚀

This Research Assistant Agent can:

* **Search for information** from various sources.
* **Drawback Analysis** based on the abstract that gather from the keyword given.
* **Summarize articles and documents** to give you the key points.
* **Organize research findings** into a structured format.

## How it works 🛠️

This agent is built with the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, a powerful framework for creating AI agents. The ADK allows us to define the agent's behavior and connect it to various tools, like search engines and document readers.

The agent uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, like **Gemini**, to understand your requests and generate human-like responses.
